This is a really simple form built using tkinter, it allows to input
client data and save it in a database.

It's built using tkinter.
It uses sqlalchemy to interact with the database.

I wrote this as an excercise for me, because it's fun and I like programming.

If you like you can suggest any improvments. Thanks.
